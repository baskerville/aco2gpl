INSTALLATION

The software is written in ANSI C
in order to compile just run 'make'

USAGE

  cat example.aco | ./aco2html > /tmp/converted.html

The program reads from standard input the ACO file
and outputs to standard output the generated HTML file.

CREDITS

The example.aco file is from http://miles.burke.id.au/blog/
Actually I wrote aco2html in order to convert this file
into HTML :)
